# Radix
This is a late-night project to get some understanding of converting numbers to and from any Radix given an alphabet.  

To run the tests, run `build.sh`.  

I did this without an IDE or dependency management, because I thought that would be fun.  Just me, Java, and the open road (thanks Tyler).
